With a range of 0 to 116 years old, the UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset. More than 20,000 face photos with age, gender, and ethnicity annotations make up the dataset. There is a lot of difference in the photos' poses, facial expressions, lighting, occlusion, quality, etc. Numerous tasks, such as face detection, age estimate, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc., could be accomplished with this dataset.

The project's goal is to use face image analysis to detect age and gender. To classify the photos, a convolutional neural network is employed. There are two sorts of output: age and gender (M or F).
